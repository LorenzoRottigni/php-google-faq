                    The recent <a href='#'> decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union </a> has profound consequences for search engines in Europe. The court ruled
                    that some users have the right to ask search engines such as Google to remove results for search keywords that include their name. In order
                    to be removed, the displayed results must be inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive.
                </p>",

                "<p>
                    Since this decision was published on May 13, 2014, we have worked tirelessly to comply with it. This is a complex procedure because we have
                    to evaluate every single request and make a balance between the individual's right to control their personal data and everyone's right 
                    to know and distribute information.
                </p>",

                "<p>
                    To submit a removal request, please fill out this <a href='#'> web form </a>. You will receive an automatic reply confirming the receipt of your request.
                    We will then evaluate your case (please note that it may take some time as we have already received so many similar requests). In evaluating
                    the request, we will consider whether the results include outdated information relating to your private life. We will also consider whether
                    there is a public interest in the information remaining in our search results, for example if it relates to financial fraud, professional
                    malpractice, criminal convictions or your public conduct in connection with a public office (elected or unelected). These assessments are
                    complex, and as a private organization we may not be in the right position to make decisions about your case. If you disagree with our assessment,
                </p>",

                "<p>
                    In the coming months, we will work closely with data protection authorities and other authorities to refine our approach. The CJEU's decision 
                    represents a significant change for search engines. We are concerned about its consequences, but we also believe it is important to respect the
                    Court's decision and are working to put in place a procedure that is compliant with the law. 
                </p>",

                "<p>
                    When you search for a name, you may find a notification explaining that the results may have been changed to comply with European data protection
                    laws. We show this notification to European users when they search for most names, not just pages that have been subject to a removal.

                    the <a href='#'> URL of the search </a> results page may contain the search query you entered. If you use SSL search (Google's encrypted search feature), in most cases the search terms are not sent as part of the URL in referrer URLs. This
                    behavior can be an exception, for example if you use some less popular browsers. More information on SSL research can be found <a href='#'>here</a>. Search queries or information contained in the referrer URL may be available through 
                    oogle Analytics or an Application Programming Interface (API). Additionally, advertisers may receive information relating to the exact keywords that triggered the click on an ad.
